This is the programming final project of the UC3M.
The game is made using the [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel) library that allows us to make simple games using pixel arts.

## How to run it 
Type the following pip command in your terminal to install pyxel:
`pip install pyxel`

Then, open the location where you cloned/downloaded this repo in your computer and run it by doing (Make sure you're using python 3):
`python lemmings.py`
